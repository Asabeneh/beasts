To achieve responsive web design on any layout, 

we must ensure the layout contains: 
    - scalable fluid media e.g images
    - scalable typography 
    - lazy loading (if possible)


# Dev Tips 

These are some steps to achieve responsive elements for your layout 




  <img 
      <!-- Declare the fallback image for all non picture supporting browsers -->
      src="horse-350.jpg" 

      <!-- Declare all of the image sizes in srcset. Include the image width using the w descriptor so the browser knows the width of each image.-->
      srcset="horse-350.jpg 350w,
      horse-500.jpg 500w,
      horse-1024.jpg 1024w,
      horse.jpg 2000w" 

      <!-- Sizes are what tells the browser our site layout. Here we're staying for any viewport that is 64ems and bigger use an image that will occupy 70% of the viewport -->
      sizes="(min-width: 64em) 70vw,

      <!-- If the viewport isn't that big, then for any viewport that is 37.5ems and bigger use an image that occupies 95% of the viewport -->
      (min-width: 37.5em) 95vw,

      <!-- and if the viewport is smaller than that then use an image that occupies 100% of the viewport-->
      100vw"

      <!-- always have alt text.-->
      alt="A horse" />
